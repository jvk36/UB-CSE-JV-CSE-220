# This test rule represents a way to run a battery of tests effectively,
# but is more complicated than running a single test.  It requires
# understanding both shell scripting and the interaction between Make
# and the shell.  The next rule (testone) shows how you would
# individually run your program against a single file and then compare
# it.

# This is how you would run a single text.  Note that you may not want
# to redirect output (and may want to pipe into something like od or xxd
# instead) for your own testing, as follows:
#
# ./untabify < inputs/atabz.tzt | od -t x1 -a
#
# You could also, of course, just run the command as below and then
# examine the output file:
#
# od -t x1 -a outputs/atabz.txt
#
# The @ sign before the second line instructs Make not to print the
# command, but only the output of the command.
