 * barrier_wait() should do the following:
 * 1. The number of threads waiting on the barrier (nwaiting) must be incremented, 
 *    and compared against the number of threads the barrier is configured to wait for (nthreads)
 * 2. If nthread == nwaiting, the barrier condition has been met, and all threads should be released.
 *    Otherwise, the current thread should block until some thread satisfies that condition. 
 * 
 * Note 1: You must use lock to protect the state of the barrier, and barrier as the condition 
 *         variable on which the waiting threads block. 
 * Note 2: Your barrier implementation does not have to operate more than once. Once a barrier 
 *         has released its threads, its work is done.
